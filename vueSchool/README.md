## Notes

[**V-model** *directive*](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/v-model.html) is a way to bind information input, keeping data in sync.

V-model can take modifiers, include a period and then the modifier to provide different actions, such blurring text, trimming the white space and changes strings of numbers to numbers.

If you are using input such a radio buttons or selects, then they are bound through the value provided, not the label content.

You can also use this to bind data from a series through creating an array and binding through a checkbox option.
