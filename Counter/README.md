# Section 1 - Counter App

The function of this application is to show the difference between Vue and Vanilla JavaScript.

You can compare the [JavaScript Counter](./JSApp) to the [Vue Counter](./VueCounter/). The JS application will use Live Server to view the application. See the command below for Vue.

## Getting started with Vue

You can create all the items from scratch, or you can use the Vue CLI.

The CLI to start this is `npm init vue@latest`, after you have answer templating questions, be sure to run `npm install`

To start the application. `npm run dev`

The enter point to the application is [App](./VueCounter/src/App.vue).

## State

Managed within the Vue app.

## Event Handling

There is built in event handling so you can update state within the same element.
