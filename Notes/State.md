# State

Managed within the Vue app.

## Data

Content that is directly referenced within the application can be stored in a data variable inside of `Vue.create({})`

## Props

Pass state from one element to another.

## Watch

Provides a way to consistently check if input/state has changed and provides rendering accordingly.

The watch takes in two parameters. The first is a function that returns the value you want to "listen to" if it changes. The second is a call back handler that we will use when we want to change the value of the element.

## Life Cycle Hooks

These live as their entities inside of scripts.
