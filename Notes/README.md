## General

There is only one index.html passed in - Single Page Application.

While Vue documents look like HTML, you must place them inside a *template* tag as the parent element. Template itself will not appear on the client side HTML.

*Scope* attribute inside of your style within a specific Vue document will prevent your style from being used across Vue documents.

### Components

Small element, or object with a number of options that are accessible as long as they are imported into the related documents.

You always create components with lowercase characters, regardless of how these were previously stated.
