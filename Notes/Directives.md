# Directives

Instructions for Vue to do specific actions placed on an HTML element.

You provide the v-directiveName after the opening tag element.

Vue [comes with a number of these built-in options](https://vuejs.org/api/built-in-directives.html)

Some directives will even allow you to use JavaScript methods on them.

These are processes that can be applied to elements.

Examples:

- [v-if / v-else](./Logic.md/#if)
- [v-for](./Logic.md/#looping)
