# Routes

[Official docs](https://router.vuejs.org/installation.html)

This application uses [vue-router](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-router)

The router is provided to the main doc from an index file where rules are laid out.

Then the component itself is added to App.vue via RouterView.

To prevent a complete page refresh on different components, you will need to use RouterLink for any anchor links within the application.
