# Methods

Functions used inside an application will be stored inside of `Vue.create({}` inside of a methods object.

It's important to note that you won't have direct access to the data. You will need to bind the information by using `this`. This also means you can't use arrow functions.

You will not be required to instantiate the function when you reference it.
