# Events

There is built-in event handling, so you can update the state within the same element.

## v-on

[**v-on**](https://vuejs.org/api/built-in-directives.html#v-on)
 allow for event triggering.

 You can use a shorthand `@` to replace it with v-on. You don't need the colon at this point, either.

 The `@click` event is not restricted to things like buttons. It can actually be used on most elements.
